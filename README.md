# Government-Workforce-Ethnicity

During my Introduction to Python Programming course with Code First Girls, My two teammates and I completed a project on spreadsheet analysis using python. We were required to analyse given data. To extend the project we decided to analyse and summarise the Ethnicity Facts and Figures available on [gov.uk](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/).

Looking at the Workforce Diversity in the [Workforce and Business](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business) section, we focused on:
- [Civil Service Workforce](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/civil-service-workforce/latest)
- [Fire and Rescue Workforce](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/fire-and-rescue-services-workforce/latest)
- [Prison Officer Workforce](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/prison-officer-workforce/latest)
- [Social Workers for Children and Families](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/social-workers-for-children-and-families/latest)

Using the csv's provided we:
- Compare the total number of people from different ethnicities working in the different workforces stated above, in 2015 and 2019 (2016/17 and 2017/18 for Social Workers).
- Compare the ethnicity percentage breakdown and percentage change in ethnicity for 2015 and 2019 (2016/17 and 2017/18 for Social Workers).
- Allow the user to input one of the workforces above to get a summary output and summary csv. This summary includes for each ethnicity, the total amount and percentage of the workforce for both 2015 and 2019 (2016/17 and 2017/18 for Social Workers) and the change in percentage over the two years.

# Extension
To further extend this I will create a a plot of the changes in percentage using matplotlib.
